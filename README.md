## Aviation Accidents Analysis

### Overview 

The project aims to support the development of a new aviation business line by providing three business recommendations based on thorough data analysis.

The objective is to identify the lowest-risk aircraft makes and models for the company to consider for its new aviation ventures. The analysis focuses on key variables such as aircraft make and model, fatalities, time of accidents and accident locations. By addressing missing data, interpreting and visualizing the information, the analysis seeks to offer data-driven insights.
The findings will help the company mitigate potential risks and make informed decisions about aircraft purchases, ensuring a safe and strategic entry into the aviation market.


### Business Understanding

Company is expanding into the aviation industry to diversify it's portfolio by purchasing and operating aircrafts for profit enterprises. The company needs to expand knowledge about aviation business and the potential risks associated with different aircrafts. Questions this analysis will try to answer include - which directions of aviation business to consider, which aircraft present the lowest risk and what factors contribute to evaluated safety.

### Source of data


Main data source is The National Transportation Safety Board aviation accident dataset with information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters. Detailed accidents reports can be accessed on NTSB website.


### Data Understanding and Analysis

In this analysis we focus on business charter flights in two categories - airplanes and helicopters in the United States. We analyse relevant accidents - dated after 2005, as the aircarft industry has developed significantly and older data points can distort the findings. As an outcome of this analysis we will be able to provide lists of recommended makes for both categories based on calculating accident survival rates.
